# Customer_Segmentation
This project applies machine learning to group customers based on their behavior and spending patterns.
I cleaned and explored the dataset, then used clustering techniques (mainly K-Means) to identify meaningful customer groups.
The goal is to help businesses understand different customer types and target them more effectively.
Visualizations are included to show how each segment differs.
All code is written in Python and organized in notebooks for easy understanding.
You can run the project by installing the required libraries and opening the notebook.
The results highlight clear patterns between income, age, and spending habits.
Feel free to explore, modify, or build on the analysis.
